# MY DOTFILES AND BASIC SERVER SETUP
*Let it be known, I have **no** fucking idea what I am doing.*

I have been using Linux for 25 years. In all this time, I made no attempt to organize and backup my **.dotfiles** or standardize installation of new machines. 

I have installed a Great Numberâ„¢ of machines in my time. If I am successful with this repository, I will not have to completely rebuild my Linux environment from my addled memory every time I blow up a computer and reinstall.  *This happens quite frequently.*

To add to my general confusion, and to generally make things more complicated, I am teaching myself some other new things. This is in addition to learning how to use [yadm](https://yadm.io/) and **git** to manage my dotfiles.
- I am learning Lua
- I am learning how to code for a FiveM server
- I am learning Markdown
- I am learning **VS Code Server**

This is all at the same time. *I think my head is about to explode.* 
That is what happens when you're 55 years old and don't have a clue what you're doing.

I hope these notes help someone.

# Shit To Do on New Linux Build
I have a desktop that runs Windows 11 with WSL. I can also boot it into Linux with a drive bay where I can swap the SSD. I have a couple of laptops, too. One of them is dedicated to Linux. I also have access to a couple of virtual servers. Finally, I have a pair of Raspberry Pi machines I laughingly call *servers*. All running Linux, yet all looking different. I want them to be the same. I want it to be familiar every time I shell into a machine or fire up a terminal. So, after 25 years of running Linux, I am finally trying to get organized and make sense of things.

Behold, the fruits of my labor. Please excuse the dust. *And mind the gap.*

## SSH SETUP
- Generate SSH keys for secure passwordless SSH logins using the command `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`. Be sure to generate a password for this key.
- The private key (your identification) will be save in the `~/.ssh/id_rsa` file under your home directory.
- The public key will be save in the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file.
- Upload your key to the host with the command `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa <user>@server-ip`
- Login to the remote server with the command `ssh <user>@server-ip`. You should be prompted for the password you generated for the key.
- Once you are logged in, you can log out and test the key. Type `exit`
- Log in once again `ssh <user>@server-ip`

If everything works, you can now log in with no password required for this server.

### SSH SETUP FOR GITHUB LOGINS
Create and upload an SSH key to Github. Once the key is on file, you can edit the `~/.ssh/config` to have the key used for passwordless logons. Add the following.
```
Host github.com
  User davefl67
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/davefl67_rsa
  ForwardAgent yes
  PubkeyAuthentication yes
  ```
  To test the login, you will need to have the SSH Agent running. You should add a command to `~/.bashrc` The command is `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"` and this will load the agent in the background. To test passwordless login, type this command: `ssh -vT git@github.com`

  When using git and are prompted for a user name, always use `git@github.com`. It will automatically use your SSH key and find your account. Check the [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/error-permission-denied-publickey) for troubleshooting assistance

### HARDEN SSHD SERVER SECURITY
You'll need to harden the server's **sshd** configuration to allow for passwordless logins only. There are a few other tips and tricks as well.
- edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to harden security
- Change `Port` to something obscure higher than 2048
- Change `PasswordAuthentication` to **no**
- Change `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` to **no**
- Change `ListenAddress` from `0.0.0.0` to the ip address of a VPN tunnel or a Tailscale IP address. This allows connections only from that private network.

Once complete, restart the SSH server with the following command
`sudo systemctl restart ssh`

## ADDING NONFREE AND CONTRIB REPOSITORIES
Debian only provides free (as in freedon) software by default. Other repositories are available.

To add these repositories:
1. `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
2. `sudo apt install software-properties-common -y`
3. `sudo apt-add-repository contrib non-free`

## DOTFILES IN GITHUB
Once `yadm` is installed, common dotfiles are available in a [private Github repo](https://github.com/davefl67/dotfiles)
1. `yadm init`
2. `yadm clone -f` 

## OTHER PACKAGES
- [tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download/linux)
- [pfetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pfetch/releases)
- [moar](https://github.com/walles/moar/releases/latest)
- [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/releases/latest)
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/latest)
- [ctop](https://github.com/bcicen/ctop/releases)
- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/releases/latest)

## STARSHIP PROMPT
Install the [Starship prompt](https://starship.rs/#quick-install) for some colorful fun at the command line. Be sure also to copy or setup `~/.config/starship.toml` from the existing [dotfiles](https://github.com/davefl67/dotfiles). You will also need to install at least one [Nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com) to be able to see the glyphs, ligatures, and other cool shit. Download and copy font files into `~/.local/share/fonts` for a single user or `~/usr/local/share/fonts` for global use.

## TWEAK AND EDIT TO SUIT
- `~/.bashrc`
- `~/.bash_aliases`
- `~/.profile`
- `~/.tmux.conf`

# DOCKER MAGIC
When installing Docker, you will need to add your user to the `docker` group to be able to run docker containers without sudo.
1. Run `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
2. Log out of your account
3. Log back in. Run `groups $USER` to verify membership

## PORTAINER
Once Docker is running on the new machine, the first package to install is either [Portainer](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install-ce/server/docker/linux) or [Portainer Agent](https://docs.portainer.io/admin/environments/add/docker/agent). 

If using Portainer Agent, this will be an *environment* linked to another Portainer instance. Once Portainer Agent is installed, add this machine to the Portainer installation on **PENNY**

## CLOUDFLARE
To allow zero-trust tunnel to access the containers on this machine, you will need to install the [cloudflared](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared) container. Once running, you can access the Cloudflare website and set up hstnames to point to the web interfaces of your containers securely.

## WATCHTOWER
You'll need to install the [watchtower](https://hub.docker.com/r/containrrr/watchtower) container to keep all your containers running on the latest version.

### Other stuff to do
- link relevant .dotfiles to `/root` user folder

### Trash bin for CLI
Something to try is `trash-cli` which is a trash or recycle bin for the command line.

### Is this WSL2?
-  [Read this](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support)
- Enable systemd
- Enable graphical apps

### VNC
If this machine is to have a GUI desktop, set up a VNC server

### visudo
- Use visudo to eliminate sudo password
  - At the end of the `/etc/sudoers` file add:
  - `dave  ALL=(A::) NOPASSWD:ALL`
  - Log -dave- out of all sesions
  - Log in again
