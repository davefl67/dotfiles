# Eventually this will be something.
Let it be known, I have **no** fucking idea what I am doing. 

This will eventually be where I will put my .dotfiles. You know, so I do not have to completely rebuild my Linux environment every time I blow up a computer and reinstall.

*This happens quite frequently.*

I have a desktop that runs Windows 11 with WSL. I can also boot it into Linux with a drive bay where I can swap the SSD.
 
I have a couple of laptops, too. One of them is dedicated to Linux. I also have access to a couple of virtual servers.
 
Finally, I have a pair of Raspberry Pi machines I laughingly call *servers*. All running Linux, yet all looking different.

I want them to be the same. I want it to be familiar every time I shell into a machine or fire up a terminal.

So, after 20+ years of running Linux, I am finally trying to get organized and make sense of things. 

To make things more complicated, I am teaching myself some other new things. In addition to learning how to use **git** to manage my dotfiles, I am learning my way around Markdown, and **VS Code Server** all at the same time. 

*I think my head is about to explode.*
 
That is what happens when you're 55 years old and don't have a clue what you're doing.
